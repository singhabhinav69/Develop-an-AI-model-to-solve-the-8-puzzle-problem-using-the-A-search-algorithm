# Develop-an-AI-model-to-solve-the-8-puzzle-problem-using-the-A-search-algorithm
The 8-puzzle problem consists of a 3x3 grid of tiles, where one tile is blank (denoted as 0), and the other tiles are numbered from 1 to 8. The goal is to move the tiles around to reach a target configuration, starting from an initial state.

To solve this problem using the A* search algorithm, we need to:
1. **Define a state representation** for the puzzle.
2. **Define a heuristic function** to guide the search.
3. **Define the A* search algorithm**.

Let's break down the steps involved:

### 1. Representing the State
A state can be represented as a list or a tuple of 9 elements (0-8), where 0 represents the blank tile. The state could look like this:

```
[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 0]
```

This represents the goal state where the tiles are in the correct order and the blank tile is in the last position.

### 2. Defining the Heuristic
A common heuristic for the 8-puzzle problem is **Manhattan distance**. This is the sum of the absolute differences in the horizontal and vertical distances of each tile from its target position.

For example, if a tile '1' is located at position (0, 0) in the current state, and in the goal state, it should be located at (0, 0), then the Manhattan distance for that tile is 0. If it were in position (1, 0), the Manhattan distance would be 1 (1 step down).

### 3. A* Search Algorithm
A* combines the **cost function (g(n))** (the number of steps taken to reach the current state) and the **heuristic function (h(n))** to evaluate the total cost of each state, which is given by:
\[ f(n) = g(n) + h(n) \]

Where:
- \( g(n) \) is the actual cost to reach the state \( n \) from the initial state (number of moves).
- \( h(n) \) is the heuristic estimate of the cost to reach the goal from state \( n \).

A* algorithm proceeds by exploring the states with the lowest \( f(n) \) values, and it guarantees finding the optimal solution if the heuristic is admissible (i.e., it never overestimates the cost).

### 4. Implementation

Now, let's look at an implementation of the 8-puzzle problem using A* search.

```python
import heapq

# Define the goal state
GOAL_STATE = (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, )
# A* search algorithm
def a_star_search(start_state):
    # Initialize the open list (priority queue) and closed list
    open_list = []
    closed_list = set()
    
    # We use a heap queue to always expand the state with the lowest f(n)
    heapq.heappush(open_list, (0 + manhattan_distance(start_state), 0, start_state, []))
    
    while open_list:
        # Pop the state with the lowest f(n)
        f, g, current_state, path = heapq.heappop(open_list)
        
        # If the current state is the goal state, return the solution
        if current_state == GOAL_STATE:
            return path + [current_state]
        
        # Mark the current state as explored
        closed_list.add(current_state)
        
        # Explore neighbors
        for neighbor in get_neighbors(current_state):
            if neighbor not in closed_list:
                # Calculate the cost (g) and the heuristic (h)
                new_g = g + 1
                new_h = manhattan_distance(neighbor)
                new_f = new_g + new_h
                
                # Add the neighbor to the open list
                heapq.heappush(open_list, (new_f, new_g, neighbor, path + [current_state]))
    
    return None  # No solution found

# Example usage:
start_state = (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 0, 8)
solution = a_star_search(start_state)

# Print the solution path (sequence of states)
if solution:
    for step in solution:
        print(step)
else:
    print("No solution found.")

### Explanation
1. **State Representation**: We represent the state as a tuple of 9 integers (0-8), with 0 representing the blank tile. 
2. **Manhattan Distance Heuristic**: The function `manhattan_distance(state)` computes the sum of the Manhattan distances for each tile from its current position to its goal position.
3. **Neighbors Function**: The function `get_neighbors(state)` generates all possible valid states that can be reached by moving the blank tile (0) up, down, left, or right
4. **A* Search**: 
   - The priority queue (`open_list`) is used to explore states based on their \( f(n) = g(n) + h(n) \) values. 
   - We expand the state with the lowest \( f(n) \) first, ensuring we explore the most promising states.
   - The `closed_list` ensures we donâ€™t revisit previously explored states.
5. **Result**: If the goal state is found, the sequence of moves (states) leading from the start to the goal is returned. If no solution is found, it returns `None`.

### Example:
For an initial state like:

(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 0, 8)
The algorithm will print the sequence of states to transform it into the goal state:
(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 0, 8)
(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 0)
This is a minimal case, but the algorithm works for any valid initial state. The search will efficiently find the optimal sequence of moves.
